            Hello! My name is Julia Castillo Trujillo and Iâ€™m a developer from
            Spain passionate about web development, good design and
            accessibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            I recently graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a
            first-class degree in MInf Informatics, where I was able to work in
            multiple projects using different programming languages such as
            Java, C, Python, React Native, etc. However, after trying my hand at
            different languages, I found a passion for web development, and
            especifically, frontend development.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my spare time, I like to learn languages (currently studying
            Chinese), organise my life with Notion, find ways to be more
            productive and learn about web development and accessibility.
