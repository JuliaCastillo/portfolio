          JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX, a NASA API and the FatFree framework (a PHP

        <p>
          A website for Women Empowered, a conference in celebration of
          International Womenâ€™s Day and aimed to commemorate the achievements of
          women in different fields and to advocate for the acceleration of
          gender parity and inclusivity.

          It was developed using Jekyll, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and JQuery. I
          was in charge of designing and implementing the schedule section,
          where I used a JavaScript library called Papa Parse to dynamically
          retrieve the schedule information from a Google Sheets document, which
          was then processed and displayed using JQuery.
