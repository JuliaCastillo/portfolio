          It was developed using Jekyll, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I was in
          charge of designing and implementing the schedule section, where I
          used a JavaScript library called Papa Parse to retrieve the schedule
          information from a Google Sheets document, which was then processed
          and displayed.
